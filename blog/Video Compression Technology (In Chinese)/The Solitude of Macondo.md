“One Hundred Years of Solitude” is a landmark novel by Gabriel García Márquez, first published in 1967. It is a prime example of magical realism, blending the fantastical with the mundane to explore the cyclical nature of history and human experience.

## Plot Summary
The novel chronicles the rise and fall of the Buendía family over seven generations in the fictional town of Macondo. The story begins with **José Arcadio Buendía** and his wife, Úrsula Iguarán, who founded Macondo. As the family grows, they experience love, war, wealth, and tragedy, often repeating the same mistakes as their ancestors.

## Major Themes
The Cyclical Nature of History

## Solitude
Solitude is a pervasive theme, affecting each character in different ways. The Buendías are often isolated by their obsessions, secrets, and personal tragedies. This solitude ultimately leads to their downfall.

## Magical Realism
García Márquez uses magical realism to blend the extraordinary with the ordinary. Events such as the ascension of Remedios the Beauty to heaven and the rain of yellow flowers are presented as normal occurrences, highlighting the surreal nature of the world he creates2.

## Key Characters

## Symbolism
